<p style="text-align:center;"> Now, you might wonder, what do 6 people living in a house do together as a family? Well here's my answer to your question: </p>
<hr>

<h1 style="text-align:left;font-size:30px;"> 1)VIDEO GAMES UNTIL DAWN </h1>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Out of the 4 sibling, only Aiman and Daya are avid gamers that play consistently but collectively all of us siblings enjoy playing video games, especially when it requires a whole lot of teamwork (because we all suck at it). Most of the time, the gameplay does not end too well. For example, a survival team-based game called Dont Starve Together, often gets the quartet to die to hideous monsters many times but in the end its not winning that matters but the quality time spent talking between the siblings </p>

<h2 style="text-align:left;font-size:30px;"> 2)KARAOKE </h2>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Nothing beats a classic jam out session with the family. The Rusli's are not singers, but in a room where no one can sing, no one can be the judge of your singing ability. Therefore, without a cloud of judgement, all 6 individuals can enjoy lung-busting synergy. Funnily enough, Rusli being a music lover was able to nab a whole karaoke machine to be personally used by the family. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;font-size:30px;"> 3)BARBECUE </h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"> A good ol' smoking grill brings the feistiest of people together. Often times, whenever the family is back together, the Rusli household does yummy barbecue picnics on the balcony. Rusli and Aiman are assigned grill duty while the rest of the ladies prepare the ingredients to be grilled. On a cool breezy night with the stars all aglow, the Rusli's enjoy filled up tummies listening to chill tunes. </p>

<h4 style="text-align:left;font-size:30px;"> 4)MAKE FUN OF FATHER </h4>
<p style="text-align:left;">It's not as bad as you might think, maybe. In all honesty, the 4 siblings find bonding between family members is a relationship that you can be transparent with and throw in a few jokes. Over breakfast, lunch or dinner, the Rusli family enjoys quality laughs and giggles between each other, especially telling jokes about Rusli himself. All jokes aside, obviously the 4 siblings don't mean the context of their jokes and no harm is meant to be done. In a way, the laughs that were shared have only made their bond stronger.</p>
