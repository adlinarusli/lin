<h1 style="color:navy;font-size:30px;text-align:center;background-color:lightgrey;"> AS A FAMILY WHERE DO WE SEE OURSELVES IN THE NEAR FUTURE? </h1>
<hr>
<p> First and foremost, all of us kids are around our 20's with me being in my final teen year as of 2022. The shift in family phases has now put us in a place where each individual is an adult that has their own individual plans and dreams.
<br>
<hr>
Daya is working now, and about to move into her own house soon in Kuala Lumpur, Aiman is still finishing uni and Hana has roughly around 1 year to go in the UK. As for me, I am now entering my 2nd semester of college and going to be overall finish my IB diploma in June of 2023. 
<br>

Although bittersweet, it is the time where all of us will start to go our separate ways to live our own lives. However, this doesn't signify that it will be all over for us. We've planned out our future so it feels as if everyday is a day back like the old days of 4 kids hanging out with their parents
<br>
<hr>
Hana plans on staying in the UK to work and I am targeting to go to a UK university too when I finish my IB diploma. Therefore, hopefully, it wont feel to different since I would have a sister to go to any time I needed. Rusli and Sofia are retiring soon anyways, and they plan on travelling and enjoying the next phase of their lives with little to no responsibilities anymore. Rusli specifically plans on visiting the UK and Europe in general to see his kids often and at the same time see the world that he couldn't in his youth.

Furthermore, in the age of technology and advancements, hopping countries over might not seem so far away anymore. Us 4 siblings are not going to stop calling each other. Playing games, video calls or in general just keeping in contact with one another, family will always be around. </p>
