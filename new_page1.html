<h2 style="text-align:center;background-color:black;color:white;"><b> LETS GET A BIT MORE SPECIFIC </b></h2>

<h3 style="text-align:center;background-color:darkgrey;"><b> dive into the siblings! </b></h3>
<hr>

<h4 style="text-align:center;font-size:30px;"><b> DAYA </b></h4>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:center;"> First born daughter of an Asian family, need I say more? Daya is the reliable, supportive and responsible sister a girl could ever wish for. Currently working as an electrical engineer (same as her mother) at a consultant company, the 26-year old is set and ready to live her best life. Not to mention, Daya is a first-class graduate from the University of Nottingham, obtaining her masters in electrical engineering back in 2018.
<br>
To Adlina, Daya means everything. A strong-willed older figure who always taught her to never give up on her dreams. Now although not everyday is rainbows and butterflies between sisters, Adlina wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
<hr>

<h5 style="text-align:center;font-size:30px;"><b> AIMAN </b></h5>

<p style="text-align:center;"> The only boy between the siblings! Aiman is a charismatic 23-year old who is studying software engineering in University. Growing up surrounded by 3 sisters may be extremely exhausting, but as Aiman grew up, the bond between the 4 siblings were genuinely sincere.  Aiman loves to game, in a large range of genre as well. From World of Warcraft all the way to Subnautica, if the game gets him a good smile, he will for sure be playing. 
<br>
Furthermore, Aiman loves to edit videos. In secret, Aiman has a private YouTube channel where he uploads all of his skits and short videos that he edited for fun. To be fair, most of which were videos requested by his own siblings.</p>
<hr>

<h6 style="text-align:center;font-size:30px;"><b> HANA </b></h6>
<p style="text-align:center;"> The honorable middle child. This 21-year old free-spirited girl has a played a pivotal role in Adlina's life. Hana is a pharmacist-to-be, currently studying in Nottingham, England. In her free time, Hana indulges into photography, reading, writing and consuming media content. Hana has a background in debating and public speaking, continuously representing her school, colleges and country in either regional or international competitions. A smart cookie with the purest heart of gold, Hana is an all-rounder with honestly the worst sense of humor.
<br>
Adlina and Hana have a 3 year age gap, being the sibling with the closest age gap to Adlina. Hana and Adlina share a very love-hate relationship, only ever to grow close in their teen years. Now, its very apparent that the sister relationship between them holds a very special meaning to Adlina.</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:center;"> That's me! The youngest of the 4! </p>
<hr>

<center><h8 style="text-align:center;font-size:30px;"><b> SSAM-SSAM </b></h8></center>
<p style="text-align:center;"> An emotional support family cat for the Rusli's. Ssam is a 1-year old cat that doesn't actually do much around the house besides sleep around for 12 hours straight. The Rusli's have raised Ssam ever since he was born and has developed a very special connection to this fat cat. Ssam enjoys chicken, his favourite food in the world, alongside his afternoon naps in his personal box that he made his bed. Fun fact, Ssam was raised inside the house for the majority of his life so Ssam is not afraid of anything related to humans including vacuums, hair dryers, loud TV's and many more. This cat plays a large role in keeping the Rusli's distracted from their everyday problems and is an important aspect to the family.</p>
